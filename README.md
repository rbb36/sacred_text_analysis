# Sacred Text Analysis
### Data analytics based on some of the most influential documents in human history.

This project will use natural language processing algorithms to help understand the terms in humanity's sacred texts.

These are some of the most influential documents in our shared history. People put their hearts and literal souls into understanding and being good stewards of these texts.

My goal is to exclude contemporary opinion, to provide the algorithms for your consideration, and to provide data that helps illuminate the manuscripts.
